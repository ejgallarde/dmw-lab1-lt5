Title: ‘Grab Food Security’ / ‘From Plate to  State: Food Security ’ /  

 
Problem Statement 

Our research endeavors to analyze a recipe dataset, aiming to identify the most frequently used ingredients, specifically the top 10. Subsequently, we seek to assess the availability of these ingredients in the Philippines and their reliance on imports. To achieve this, we will employ customs data to gauge the volume and value of imported food items on an annual scale by aggregating monthly data. This study's overarching objective is to provide informed insights to policymakers regarding the nation's food security and potential alternative sources for these essential ingredients.

Methodology 

(Sample only) 

Our methodology consists of five essential steps to analyze data efficiently. The first step is data exploration, where we gain insights into the data by understanding its characteristics and identifying any outliers or anomalies. The second step is data preprocessing, where we clean, transform, and prepare the data for analysis. The third step involves clustering implementation and frequent itemset analysis, where we group similar data points and identify frequent patterns within the data. The fourth step is to draw conclusions and insights from the results obtained in the previous steps. Finally, we provide recommendations based on the insights gained to support informed decision-making. By following this methodology, we can ensure that we obtain accurate results and insights from the data while ensuring its relevance and significance. These steps are to be discussed further on later sections of the study 

first – data exploration 

second – data processing (cleaning, filtering, ranking, finding patterns) 

 

Sample – We will explore ingredients that are most used from the Recipe Ingredients Dataset and match with ingredients that are imported (as seen in the Customs import dataset). Initial research questions are formulated. 

 

Explore and Modify – apply typical data exploratory techniques such as computing for measures of central tendencies (mean, median, mode) and check for outliers. Missing data points will have to be fixed by common imputation techniques. This is where we will formulate the final research questions. 

Results and Analysis – Identify the answers to the research questions formulated. We will provide, tables, graphs and other relevant visualizations. 

 

Conclusions & Insights – interpretation of the results. Recommendations for consumers and policy makers to achieve food security in the country. 

 

Initial Research Questions: 

Recipe-ingredients dataset 

Most commonly found ingredient among all the recipes (top 10) 

Customs imports 

Is there a trend of what ingredient is imported per month? (Ex. what are the ingredients commonly bought for this month vs next month/quarterly basis? 

Recipe & customs imports 

How much of the top 10 ingredients/most commonly found ingredients (in ingredients dataset) are being imported to the Philippines? Where is the country of origin/where do we source those ingredients?  

What countries do we import our food ingredients from? – top 10 countries

Technical Report 

The report is to be submitted as a Jupyter notebook along with its HTML export. The notebook should be able to generate the report when run from top to bottom. It may include an unlimited number of supplementary notebooks or python files that contain all the code for processing, analyzing, and generating data and visualizations. These supplementary notebooks or codes should be referred to in the main notebook. All relevant files including images should be included as well. 

Do not include raw, preprocessed or processed data unless required by the visualization. Do not copy raw data--use their absolute filepaths on Jojie instead. Do not put in your name or other features that could identify you. This includes making sure the file path does not include your username or your LT number. 

Listed below is the review criteria generally followed for technical reports in MSDS. Although sections need not follow the exact order, name or grouping, you should make sure that the required information are in the report you submit when applicable. 

Title. Does the report have a title that succinctly reflects what the project is all about? 

Abstract. This should be laid out immediately after the report title. Does the report have an abstract that provides an overview of what the report is all about, context and problem statement, methodology used, and a summary of important insights, results of the analyes and potential recommendations of the study? 

Data Description. Does the report provide a short description of the data source? 

Data Processing. Does the report include steps taken to process the data for analysis? If ever there are data transformations, were these rationalized in the report?  

Exploratory Data Analysis. Do the analyses provide descriptions and rationale for their implementation? For example, if data are visualized and pair plots or swarm plots are provided in the EDA, does the author explain why they are there and what insights are gleaned from the visualizations? If correlations and/or probability distributions are provided, does the author elaborate on them? 

Figures, Plots and Equations. Do the figures and plots have proper labeling? Are there descriptive self-contained captions for the tables and figures? Are the variables in the equations defined properly? Are the elements referred to appropriately in the main text? 

Methodology. Does the report have a methodology section where details on the implementation of the study and justifications of parameter settings are provided?  

Results. Do the results presented make sense? Is it clear how the report has obtained its results and/or reached its conclusions? Does the report enumerate possible limitations and potential extensions of the study? 

References and Acknowledgments. Does the report have a References and Acknowledgments section? Does the citations and references follow the APA format? 

Anonymity. As far as the reviewer can tell, does it appear that the final technical report submitted for this project is a product of the student who submitted it?
